# malloc
 In this approach to malloc, I used the Next Fit algorithm for Memory Management which uses a roving pointer to start the search of new free memory from where it last allocated from. Realloc is also implemented directly using mm_malloc and mm_free. This was the final project of CS 33 Introduction to Computer Organization taught by Professor Parvaneh Ghaforyfard at the University of California, Los Angeles in the Summer Quarter of 2021.
